                <h2>Panta Ilish</h2>
                <h3 class="orenge-color">Details</h3>
                <p>Panta Ilish is a traditional food that almost every Bangladeshi eats at the Pohela Boishakh Festival
                    (the first day of Bangla year). It’s the most popular food in Bangladesh. We love this dish as it is
                    a great symbol and celebration of our culture and tradition.</p>

                <h2>Rasgulla</h2>
                <h3 class="orenge-color">Details</h3>
                <p>Rasgulla or Roshogulla (syrup filled roll) is one of the most popular sweets in Bangladesh. It is
                    traditionally eaten after lunch as the people of Bangladesh love to eat sweet dishes after a heavy
                    meal. Sweet and spongy rasgulla is also served to guests and at festivals and special occasions.</p>

                <h2>Kacchi Biryani</h2>
                <h3 class="orenge-color">Details</h3>
                <p>Kacchi Biryani is one of Bangladeshi people’s most loved foods. It is so loved, it is served at most
                    festivals and special occasions, such as weddings, picnics, etc. I love this dish. The most popular
                    biryani in Bangladesh is Dhaka Kacchi Biryani. You will always find the Dhaka street biryani stall
                    crowded because of the huge demand for this food.</p>
